	This site was built with Bootstrap.
	
	It is a responsive site. Images and videos are also responsive.
	
	No WYSIWYG software has been used. The site was built with pure hand-coding (using the IDE webstorm) 
and Google Chrome (for previewing and debugging).Although if I had some question, I would search online, 
and might use the code suggested by others to solve my problem. I have some experience with building websites before, 
but I used to rely on dreamweaver. And I'm so glad that I pushed myself to make this site with pure hand coding. 
I've learned so many things. The process is exhausting yet fun. 

	Although Bootstrap comes with some basic CSS, almost all of them have been overridden by the datavis.css file, 
which is written by me. So the visual thing is mainly my contribution. My design style is heavily influenced by 
the flat UI (which could also be seen from my PPT ^_^).

	Jquery and Javascript have been used.
	
	I created a separate page to put the navigation bar, and use javascript to load the navbar on each other page.

	I have used modals (a component from Bootstrap) to put tips and quizzes (you will find them 
on some pages and on the about page).

	Favicon has been used, and it was drawn by myself.
	
	For best user experience, it is recommended to view the website use a modern browser 
and a screen with the resolution of 1366*768.
