            <p>This part is quoted from the book of <a href="about.html#beautiful">Steele & Iliinsky (2010)</a>, p.18-20</p>
            <p>Data visualization can be a very time-consuming process. Briefly, there are 3 stages that we need to go through in order to have a successful visualization:</p>
            <p><ol><li>Formulate the question</li><li>Gather the data</li><li>Apply a visual representation</li></ol></p>
            <h4>Formulate the Question</h4>
            <p>Asking the question that drives the story you’re trying to tell is not necessarily a task that must be done at the beginning of the visualization journey. It is not until we have a good understanding of the data that we know how to ask a good question about it. However, asking a question (or at least keeping a question or set of questions in mind) can be useful when gathering and filtering the necessary data. You may want to start with a topic to focus your data search and refine your question as you gather more data. For example, let’s say we want to communicate that carrying out the U.S. Census is an enormous task. This is a good topic to start us out in our data search because it is broad enough that there are many pieces of data that can help give context to this idea. We could find the relevant data and create a visualization based on:</p>
            <p><ul><li>The number of surveys filled out</li><li>The number of pencils used</li><li>The number of miles census workers walked</li></ul></p>
            <p>When asking a question for the purposes of creating an information visualization, we should focus on questions that are as data-centric as possible. Questions that begin with “where,” “when,” “how much,” or “how often” are generally good starting points: they allow us to focus our search for data within a specific set of parameters, so we’re more likely to find data that lends itself to being mapped visually. Be especially careful if you find your question starts with “why.” This is a good sign that you are moving from a more formal portrayal of data into data analysis. </p>
            <h4>Gather the Data</h4>
            <p>Finding exactly the data you want can be a difficult task. Often, instead of trying to gather your own data, you’re better off taking data that is already available and trying to find a way to portray it. That is, it may be better to start (as mentioned earlier) with a dataset and construct a question as you find patterns in the data.</p>
            <p>There are many good places to start looking at data (check out the recommendations for open data sources!). </p>
            <p>Once you have the raw data, you may want parse it, organize it, group it, or otherwise alter it so that you can identify patterns or extract the specific information you wish to portray. This process is known as “data munging” and is usually an ad hoc attempt to “play around” with the data until interesting patterns emerge. If this process sounds a little opaque or nonspecific, don’t worry; we’ll walk through an example of data munging in the hands-on tutorial in the next section.</p>
            <h4>Apply a Visual Representation</h4>
            <p>After data have been gathered, the next step is to decide how to represent them. This means making decisions about what kind of visual representation of the data will aid viewers in understanding it. </p>
            <p>A visual representation is some kind of visual dimension that can change in correspondence to the data. For example: an XYgraph is a simple visual presentation that maps an x, y data point in a two-dimensional plane. Map enough points, and an obvious visual pattern may emerge even if there is no immediately identifiable pattern in the raw data itself.</p>
